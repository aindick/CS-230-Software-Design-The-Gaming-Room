# CS-230-Software-Design-The-Gaming-Room
- Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

  The Gaming Room wants a web-based game that serves multiple platforms. Draw It or Lose It is the game that want developed for other platforms since it is only available for Android devices now. Draw It or Lose it will render images from a large library of stock drawings as clues. One game consists of 4 rounds one minute each. Drawings will be rendered at a steady rate to meet the 30 second mark. If a team doesn’t solve the puzzle right in time, the other teams are able to offer one guess each to solve the puzzle with a 15 second time limit.

- What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

  I think i did really well explaining the pros and cons of each operating system.

- What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

  I found that my thoughts were clearer thanks to the document. Having a document that clearly states your requirement, constraints, and what the app needs to do helps a lot.

- If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

  I would revise the recommendation section since I felt like I didn't list enough reasons as to why I chose what I chose. I would improve it by adding more reasons as to why I chose the operating system I chose.

- How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

  I kept in mind the user's needs. A user would want a way to not use much storage on their computer, they would want the game to work on their operating system, and peace of mind that the server running the game is secure. I kept these in mind by choosing an operating system like Windows that is very popular and inexpensive to buy, kept in mind if Windows has a built in firewall, and suggesting to use a cloud system like AWS to hold the game in so the game doesn't take up space on the user's computer.


- How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

  I approached it by using the software design document. I started by writing each part one by one and checking it over to make sure I was hitting each part the client wanted. I will definitely use a software design document again since it was super helpful with clearly listing out what the client needed to be done.
